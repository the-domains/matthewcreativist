JT Smith & Associates provides automated sales solutions for tradeshow events. To put it simply, they make it easier for wholesalers to sell their products to vendors in the tradeshow environment.

Starting in 1991, JT Smith was the first company to offer this kind of software. They approached me to update their brand identity for a more cohesive and unified presence in their online and printed materials. We started with the logo, retaining the original "diamond" icon and updating the accompanying wordmark. We retained the original icon because of its recognizabilty in the tradeshow circuit, and paired it with a typeface that works well across multiple platforms. Once the logo was complete, we started developing a system of supporting graphics that could be applied to all their new materials, from letterhead to website. The end result is a much improved overall identity that is consistent across the board.
